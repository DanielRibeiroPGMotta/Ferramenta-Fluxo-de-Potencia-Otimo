The program consists in an optimum load flow tool developed in MATLAB.

Throwout a simulator, the program is able to determine the tension magnitude and angule,
of an eletrical power system, in transmission phase, to generate the maximum active and
reative power with stability, which is considered between 0.9 and 1.1 p.u.
